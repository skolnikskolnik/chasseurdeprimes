## Description: 
This is a command-line application that generates an HTML file of all of the employees on a team. There are three roles: engineer, manager, and intern. Depending on the role of the employee, the manner they are displayed in the HTML file changes.

A video of the working application can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7btoE7hhIY&feature=youtu.be">here</a>.

This is what the generated HTML looks like:
